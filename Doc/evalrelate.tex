\section{Related Work}

Yabandeh et al.\cite{yabandeh2011finding} proposed an approach to
infer almost-invariants in distributed systems. They infer the
invariants that are true in most cases and assume these invariants
only get violated due to manifestation of bugs. There are a number of
ways our approach differ from theirs: Their approach requires user to
provide a list of variables and functions that they want to consider
for inferring invariants while our approach infers distributed state
variables automatically. Moreover, they assume that an external module
generates a trace of globally consistent state system for their
algorithm while our approach extract these states through dynamic
execution of the distributed system.

Ernst et al.\cite{ernst2001dynamically} infer invariants in a
sequential program by executing the program on a collection of inputs.
This invariant detector has been released as a tool called
Daikon\cite{ernst2007daikon}. Although, we use their tool to infer
invariants, detecting invariants in a distributed system poses unique
challenges to identify distributed state and valid global states among
a larger set of variables. Ne Win et al.\cite{NeWinEGKL04} use daikon
to assist theorem provers for verifying distributed algorithms. To
demonstrate their approach, they proved the correctness of the Paxos
algorithm.
